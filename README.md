# Maze-Game

This game was created using basic C concepts such as functions, pointers, control statements, sorting and file handling.
The data structures used are arrays, stacks and queues.

The idea here is that you are the hero in a maze and you have to\n eliminate all the enemies as fast as possible. 
You must do that as quickly as you can, otherwise you will lose the game and you definitely want to avoid such a thing as much as possible.

The thing to keep in mind about Pacman is that you have to reach the end point in order to complete the game.
And while you do that you also need to figure out a way to avoid all those enemies that are coming to get you.
1. Every player has 3 lives in one game.
2. Use these keys for navigation: W - up, A - left,    S - down,    D - right
3. The ASCII CHARACTER for 207 represents the enemy and the ASCII CHARACTER for 176 represents a wall in the user interface.
4. XO OX represents the finish line.
5. When the number of lives is over, the player has lost. He then has to start over.
